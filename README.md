Abstract: In this paper, the influence of the web-post geometric parameters on shear buckling resistance of perforated steel beams with previously proposed novel non-standard elliptically-based web openings is investigated. An economical and practical approach to estimate the web-post buckling resistance in accordance with EUROCODE 3 and the buckling resistance of the strut model analogy is developed and analysed. Finite element models are developed and validated against test results available in the literature. An extensive parametric study using Python code is carried out. A total of 5,400 geometrical models is investigated and the analysed parameters are discussed in relation to the buckling curves. It is concluded that the proposed design method for the web-post buckling resistance provides accurate and reliable predictions and can be used for practical design purposes of perforated steel beams with elliptically-based web openings.
